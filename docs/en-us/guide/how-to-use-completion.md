# Code Completion

With a leading deep learning model, Alibaba Cloud AI Coding Assistant provides you with accurate line-level code completion, making coding faster. It has the following three features:

**High completion efficiency**: the deep learning model, combined with massive open-source code data and your local code context, provides you with line-level long sequence code completion results. Compared with the code completion capability that comes with the IDE, it supports you to write more code with fewer keystrokes, greatly improving your coding efficiency.

**Completion Accuracy**: Cosy integrates innovative syntax analysis capabilities, which can verify the completion content generated by the deep learning model in advance, avoiding a large number of low-quality completion content with semantic errors, making the code completion content more precise.

**Safe and lightweight**: The deep learning model used by this plugin only runs on your local machine, and will not share or upload data such as your code or personal information to other devices. Even if your device is not connected to the Internet, the normal usage of code completion would not be affected. Cosy adopts a more streamlined model with lower resource consumption, bringing you a safe and lightweight smart coding experience.
