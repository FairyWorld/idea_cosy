# FAQ

## Q：Why is there no code completion after installation, and the content cannot be searched?

A：After installing the plug-in for the first time, Cosy needs to download the model and dependent files online. After the download is complete, it can provide offline code completion, so please wait for Cosy to be initialized and try it again later. If there is no prompt "Updating Alibaba Cloud AI Coding Assistant" in the bottom column of the IDE, please restart the IDE and try again, which can usually be solved. If it still doesn't work, please report it to us at https://github.com/alibaba-cloud-toolkit/cosy/issues and attach ~/.cosy/logs/cosy.log.

## Q：Why is the plug-in stuck at "Updating Alibaba Cloud AI Coding Assistant"?

A：Same as above, please wait patiently for the model download to complete. The model will only be downloaded once, and the code completion function can be used offline after the download is complete.

## Q：Does the code search function also work offline?

A：Code search must be used while your network is connected.
